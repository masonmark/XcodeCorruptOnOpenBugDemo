A demo project to help Apple reproduce a bug whereby Xcode 4.2.1 may corrupt a project's in-memory representation, such that unit testing no longer works, when opening it under certain conditions.

The thrilling story of this bug is told at: http://masonmark.com/the-xcode-fairy

Unless you are stuck on a desert island with only Xcode 4.2.1 at your disposal, this will be of historical insterest only.
